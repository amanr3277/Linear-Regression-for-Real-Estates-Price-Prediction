# Linear-Regression-for-Real-Estates-Price-Prediction

Problem Statement

The given dataset  contains the selling prices of different houses based on different characteristics/attributes like area, no. of rooms, no. of bathrooms, etc.
At times, the property dealers appreciate the prices based on the demand and hence there is rise in prices in real estate. So, in order to cope with this problem so that it is beneficial for the customers, we must have a model in place which should tell us the ideal prices of the house based on its characteristics.
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.

Objective->
Predict the real estate prices based on multiple characteristics using a regression algorithm.
